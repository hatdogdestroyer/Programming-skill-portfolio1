# Exercise 10: Is it even


# This is how i wrote the function of the code
def main():
# This is just a prompt the user input a number
    odd_or_even=int(input("Input a number: "))
# This runs the code if a number is odd or even    
    if odd_or_even % 2 == 0:
        result = "The number is even."
        print("even")
    else:
        result = "The number is odd."
        print (result)
# The if and else helps the user identify if the code is odd or even
main()
# Now you run the code
